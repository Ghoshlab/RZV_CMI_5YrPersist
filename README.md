Abstract:

> We compared gE- and varicella zoster virus (VZV)-specific Th1 immunity in 160 adults, 50- to 85-years-old, randomized to receive live or recombinant zoster vaccine (RZV). gE-specific responses measured by IFNγ and IL2 dual-color Fluorospot were significantly higher at all timepoints post-immunization in RZV recipients. VZV-specific IL2 + memory, but not IFNγ+ or IFNγ+IL2 + effector responses, were higher in RZV recipients at ≥3 months post-immunization. Only RZV recipients maintained higher post-vaccination gE-specific IL2 + and IFNγ + and VZV-specific IL2+ responses for 5 years. The 5-year persistence of VZV-specific memory and gE-specific Th1 immunity may underlie the superior RZV efficacy.
